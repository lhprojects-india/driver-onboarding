## Role Page

**Title:** Driver role

**Content:**
As a Laundryheap Partner Driver, you will be responsible for completing a series of essential delivery and collection tasks that ensure smooth daily operations and excellent customer experience.

**Your main responsibilities include:**

**1. Facility Pick-Up**
Your route begins at one of our Laundryheap facilities, where you will collect processed items that are ready to be delivered to customers. Ensure that all items are correctly scanned and securely loaded into your vehicle.

**2. Customer Delivery**
Deliver the collected items directly to customers' addresses. Accuracy, professionalism, and punctuality are key — our goal is to provide every customer with a seamless and reliable delivery experience.

**3. Customer Pick-Up**
While on your route, you will also collect unprocessed laundry items from customers. These items must be properly tagged, scanned, and handled with care before being transported back to the facility.

**4. Facility Drop-Off**
At the end of your route, return to the facility to drop off all collected (unprocessed) items. This step completes the service cycle and ensures items are ready for processing.

## Blocks Classification Page

**Title:** Block densities

**Content:**
Our fee structure is designed to ensure fair compensation for our partner drivers by basing fees on tasks completed rather than on hourly rates. To better accommodate varying workloads, blocks are classified into:

**Block Classifications:**

| Classification | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| High Task Density | higher number of tasks with lower driving distance |
| Medium Task Density | balanced route of tasks and distance |
| Low Task Density | lower number of tasks and higher driving distance |

Each block attracts a different guaranteed fee, along with a minimum number of tasks that need to be completed and a fee for any additional tasks.

All details of the fee can be viewed in the Laundryheap Driver Application.

**Confirmation:** I understand the policy

## Fee Structure Page

**Title:** Fee Structure

**How your pay works:**
Clear minimums, predictable extras, and transparent examples.

Every delivery block (3, 4, or 5 hours) comes with a **guaranteed minimum fee**.

Even if there are fewer tasks on a given day, you'll still receive this full minimum amount.

If you complete more than the included number of tasks, you'll earn extra pay for each additional task — the busier it is, the more you make.

**Important:** Only successfully completed tasks count toward your pay. Tasks that are failed or not delivered/picked up are not paid.

**Examples by Density:**
See how minimum + extra tasks add up for different route densities.

For each block type (Low/Medium/High Density), the following information is displayed:
- Minimum fee
- Included tasks
- Extra per task
- Example calculation showing total earnings with additional tasks

**What to expect:**
- **Guaranteed minimum:** You're always paid for the block you commit to.
- **Extra earnings:** More tasks = more pay.
- **Average hourly earnings:** £12.50–£18+ (varies by city)
- **Average per-task earnings:** £4.50–£6.50 (varies by city)

**Note:** 💡 You're always covered with a **guaranteed minimum fee** — and any extra work means extra income on top of that.

**Actions:**
- I'm Happy with the Pay Structure
- Withdraw my Application
- Back to Block Classification

## How Route Works Page

**Title:** Routes and Task Addition

**Content:**
Our role structure is designed to ensure fair pay for both drivers and tasks completed rather than on hourly basis.

Each block comes with a minimum number of included tasks, meaning those tasks are already paid for as part of the block fee.

For example, a 4-hour Medium Density block includes 12 tasks, so the first 12 tasks are considered included in your block fee. If you complete more than the included tasks — let's say 15 tasks instead of 12 — the additional 3 tasks (13th, 14th, 15th) will be paid as bonus tasks, meaning you'll earn additional money for each of those extra tasks completed. This allows you to boost your earnings by taking on more tasks during your block time.

Further, our operations team may also add on-demand tasks to your route (if you have sufficient capacity and distance), allowing you to increase your earnings by completing more than the minimum included tasks that were scheduled. These added tasks are always considered bonus tasks and add to your total earnings beyond the base block fee.

Each block allocates a different guaranteed fee for low with a minimum number of tasks that need to be completed.

**Block Density Types:**
- **High-Task Density** - higher pay with more tasks requiring higher starting density.
- **Medium Density** - balanced route with good distance between tasks.
- **Low-Task Density** - Fewer number of tasks and higher driving distance.

Each block, at the fee can be viewed in the Laundryheap Driver Application.

**Confirmation:** I understand the policy

## Cancellation Policy Page

**Title:** Block Release and Cancellation Policy

**Content:**
Understanding how to manage your scheduled blocks is essential for smooth operations and to avoid unnecessary fees. Please review the following guidelines carefully.

**1. Cancelling a Block**

If you have selected a block — for example, 16th January at 5:00 PM — you can release (cancel) that block up to 48 hours before the scheduled start time.

In this case, you must release it before 5:00 PM on 14th January.

Releasing blocks in advance allows the team to reassign the slot efficiently and ensures consistent service coverage.

**Important:** If you fail to release a block with a 48-hour notice, it will be treated as a cancellation.

**Important:** A cancellation fee will apply as per Laundryheap's predefined policy. The cancellation fee will be your entire block fee.

**2. Block Release Fee**

If you release a block with more than 48 hours notice you will be charged 10% of the block fee as a block release fee.

**Confirmation:** I understand the policy

**Note:** Please read the cancellation policy carefully. You can continue in [X] second(s).

**Actions:**
- Continue
- Withdraw my Application

## Smoking Fitness Check Page

**Title:** Smoking habits policy / Physical fitness check

**Smoking habits policy:**

Please note that we strictly advise all partner drivers to handle customer orders with the utmost care. Smoking inside the vehicle is strictly prohibited, as it can cause the orders to absorb a smoke smell, which negatively affects the customer experience.

If you feel the urge to smoke, please step outside the vehicle and ensure you are far enough away so that the smoke does not enter the vehicle from the outside.

Kindly note that if we receive customer feedback regarding a smoke smell on the orders, the partner driver will be held liable for any compensation required. In addition, their access to the platform may be revoked, as such incidents severely impact customer satisfaction and brand standards.

**Options:**
- I don't smoke
- I smoke but I understand the policy

**Physical fitness check:**

Please note that drivers may encounter situations where they need to climb stairs to deliver orders to different floors when elevator facilities are not available.

We need to verify that you are physically capable of handling such situations without difficulty, as this is essential for completing deliveries to all customer locations.

**Confirmation:** I can climb stairs and have no physical difficulties that would prevent me from delivering to different floors

**Note:** Please read the policies carefully. You can continue in [X] second(s).

**Action:** Continue

---

## Liabilities Page

**Title:** Liability policy

**Content:**
Please note that if an order is lost or damaged while in your possession, you will be held responsible. For example, if an order is delivered to the wrong address, apartment, or customer and the items are lost, we may need to compensate the customer for the loss, and this cost will be passed on to you.

Similarly, if any items are stolen or go missing during your route, you will be liable for the compensation. In addition, if an item is damaged due to negligence on your part and compensation is required, the related cost will also be passed on to you.

Hence, we request all our partner drivers to be cautious while operating and to handle the orders with care to avoid any mishaps.

**Confirmation:** I understand the policy

**Note:** Please read the liability policy carefully. You can continue in [X] second(s).

**Action:** Continue
